# California Affluent 배경 (부촌 스타일)

## BACKGROUND STYLE

- Warm sunlit tones

Sky: Clear blue California sky

## MOOD

Iconic California street scene
- LA, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills vibe
- Bright sunshine, blue sky, palm trees
- West Coast lifestyle feel

## DO

- ADD palm trees in the background
- Use bright, sunny California lighting
- Keep white/cream stucco walls
- Blue sky visible
- Warm golden sunlight feel

## DON'T

- NO cold grey tones
- NO dark/overcast sky
- NO changing the composition drastically
- NO mismatch between person and background lighting

## LIGHTING ADAPTATION (CRITICAL)

1. FIRST analyze person's lighting: direction, color temp, intensity
2. Background MUST have SAME lighting characteristics
3. If person has warm sunlight → background warm tones
4. Shadow direction on background = shadow direction on person
5. Color grading must be unified across entire image

## COLOR MATCH PRIORITY

The generated image must look like ONE cohesive photo.
Person and background must have identical color temperature.
If they don't match, the image FAILS quality check.
