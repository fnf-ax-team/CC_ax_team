# Modern Industrial 배경

## BACKGROUND STYLE

Wall: Modern industrial concrete, cool gray tones
- Subtle texture, weathered but clean
- Soft blur to keep focus on person
Metal: Minimal metal shutters or panels as accent
Floor: Polished concrete or dark asphalt
- Industrial urban feel

## MOOD

Editorial, fashion-forward, urban cool, contemporary edge

## DO

- Use muted cool gray tones
- Keep textures subtle, not distracting
- Maintain clean industrial aesthetic
- Add minimal metal accents

## DON'T

- NO rust or heavy grime
- NO busy graffiti
- NO warm colors
- NO cluttered industrial elements

## LIGHTING ADAPTATION

Wall and floor MUST reflect the SAME lighting as person:
- If person has warm light: concrete shows slight warm gray undertones
- If person has cool light: concrete shows clean cool gray
- Floor shadows match person's shadow direction exactly
