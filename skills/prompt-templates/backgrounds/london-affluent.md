# London Affluent 배경 (부촌 스타일)

## BACKGROUND STYLE

Wall: London brick building exterior
- Victorian/Georgian brick OR painted brick
- Use WARM-toned brick if original is warm
- Architectural details (windows, doors) similar to original

Floor: York stone, sandstone, or warm flagstone
- Match original's color temperature
- NOT cold grey unless original is cool

## MOOD

London affluent neighborhood
- Notting Hill, Chelsea, Mayfair vibe
- Upscale but authentic
- Lived-in British residential feel

## DO

- MATCH original image's color temperature exactly
- Keep architectural structure similar to original
- Use materials that match original's warmth/coolness
- Maintain same lighting direction as original

## DON'T

- NO cold grey if original is warm
- NO red phone booths or obvious British cliches
- NO Big Ben or tourist spots
- NO changing the composition drastically
- NO mismatch between person and background tone

## LIGHTING ADAPTATION (CRITICAL)

1. FIRST analyze person's lighting: direction, color temp, intensity
2. Background MUST have SAME lighting characteristics
3. If person has warm light → use warm-toned brick (brown/red)
4. If person has cool light → use grey/blue-toned brick
5. Shadow direction on background = shadow direction on person
6. Color grading must be unified across entire image

## COLOR MATCH PRIORITY

The generated image must look like ONE cohesive photo.
Person and background must have identical color temperature.
If they don't match, the image FAILS quality check.

## WARM ORIGINAL → WARM BACKGROUND

If original has warm tones:
- Brick: brown, red-brown, warm terracotta
- Stone: warm sandstone, honey-colored York stone
- Light: golden afternoon feel
