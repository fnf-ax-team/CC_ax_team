# LA Downtown 배경

## BACKGROUND STYLE

Wall: Modern concrete or stucco, urban minimal
- Can be warm OR cool depending on original image tone
- Clean architectural lines
Floor: Concrete sidewalk or asphalt
- Urban downtown feel

## MOOD

West Coast urban, modern, effortless cool, street style

## DO

- MATCH the original image's color temperature
- If original is cool/blue: keep cool tones in background
- If original is warm: use warm tones in background
- Keep background clean and minimal
- Urban LA downtown aesthetic

## DON'T

- NO changing color temperature from original
- NO busy street traffic
- NO tourists or pedestrians
- NO overly bright or saturated colors
- NO warm tones if original is cool

## LIGHTING ADAPTATION

Background MUST match original image's lighting AND color:
- If person has COOL BLUE tones: background MUST be cool (grey concrete, blue-grey sky)
- If person has WARM tones: background MUST be warm
- Shadow direction matches person exactly
- DO NOT add warmth to cool-toned originals

## COLOR MATCH PRIORITY

CRITICAL: Preserve the original image's color grading.
If the original looks like a cool fashion editorial, the result should too.
