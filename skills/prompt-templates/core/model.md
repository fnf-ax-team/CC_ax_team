## CRITICAL RULES

EXTREME CLOSE-UP - 97% FRAME FILL - SCALE 1:1
DO NOT SHRINK. DO NOT SHRINK. DO NOT SHRINK.
The person's size must be IDENTICAL to input.

## MATHEMATICAL REQUIREMENTS

- Person height / Frame height = 0.97
- Scale factor = 1.0
- Person center = Frame center (same position)

## MODEL PRESERVATION (ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS)

1. PERSON SIZE: 100% IDENTICAL to input. NO shrinking/scaling.
2. PERSON POSITION: Same location in frame as input.
3. PERSON DETAILS: Face, body, clothing, hair, accessories - EXACT COPY.

## OBJECT PRESERVATION (CRITICAL)

KEEP ALL OBJECTS FROM ORIGINAL IMAGE.
- If there is a VEHICLE (car, motorcycle, bicycle): KEEP IT EXACTLY AS IT IS
- If there is FURNITURE (chair, table, sofa): KEEP IT EXACTLY AS IT IS
- If there are PROPS (bags, equipment, etc.): KEEP THEM EXACTLY AS THEY ARE

DO NOT REMOVE, HIDE, OR MODIFY ANY OBJECTS FROM THE ORIGINAL.
These objects are part of the composition and MUST remain visible.

## PERSON COLOR PRESERVATION (CRITICAL - DO NOT CHANGE PERSON'S COLORS)

THE PERSON'S SKIN TONE, CLOTHING COLORS, AND OVERALL COLOR MUST REMAIN **EXACTLY** AS IN THE ORIGINAL.

DO NOT apply any color grading, warming, or cooling to the PERSON.
DO NOT make the person more yellow/orange/warm.
DO NOT make the person more blue/grey/cool.

The PERSON is a DIRECT COPY from the original - same pixels, same colors.
ONLY the BACKGROUND changes. The person's colors are UNTOUCHED.

Think of it as: CUT the person from original → PASTE onto new background.
The person should look like they were photographed separately and composited.

## DO

- Keep original person exactly as-is

- NO repositioning
- NO face alterations
- NO clothing changes
- NO pose modifications
- NO hair changes

- NO changing color temperature (cool→warm or warm→cool)

The person must be a PIXEL-PERFECT copy from the original.
All objects/props MUST remain exactly as in original.
ONLY the background environment changes.
