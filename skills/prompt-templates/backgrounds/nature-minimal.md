# Nature Minimal 배경

## BACKGROUND STYLE

Wall: Natural backdrop - soft greenery, foliage
- Blurred trees or hedge
- Muted natural greens
Floor: Natural ground - grass, earth path, or simple stone
- Clean and minimal
- Not distracting

## MOOD

Fresh, natural, peaceful, serene, organic

## DO

- Use muted, desaturated greens
- Keep background very soft and blurred
- Maintain peaceful minimal aesthetic
- Suggest natural outdoor environment

## DON'T

- NO bright saturated colors
- NO flowers or busy patterns
- NO harsh sunlight dappling
- NO recognizable landmarks

## LIGHTING ADAPTATION

Background MUST reflect the SAME lighting as person:
- If person has warm light: foliage shows warm yellow-green tones
- If person has cool light: foliage shows cool blue-green tones
- Ground shadows match person's shadow direction exactly
