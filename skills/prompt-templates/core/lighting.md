## CRITICAL RULES

LIGHTING MUST BE IDENTICAL - NO EXCEPTIONS
The background MUST look like it was photographed at the SAME time, SAME place as the person.

## ANALYZE FIRST (MANDATORY)

Before generating, IDENTIFY these 4 things from the person:
1. LIGHT DIRECTION: Where is light coming from? (left/right/front/back)
2. LIGHT COLOR: Warm sunset orange? Cool blue? Neutral white?
3. SHADOW HARDNESS: Harsh (direct sun) or soft (cloudy/diffused)?
4. SHADOW ANGLE: Which way do shadows fall on body/face?

## DO

- Match light direction EXACTLY (if person lit from left, background lit from left)
- Match color temperature EXACTLY (warm person = warm background)
- Match shadow hardness EXACTLY (harsh person shadows = harsh floor shadow)
- Cast ground shadow in SAME direction as body shadows
- Keep background lighting SIMPLE and CONSISTENT

## DON'T

- NO flat/even lighting when person has directional light
- NO cool background when person has warm sunset light
- NO soft shadows when person has harsh direct sun shadows
- NO shadow in wrong direction
- NO bright background when person is in shadow
- NO dark background when person is in bright light

## GROUND SHADOW RULE

Person's feet MUST cast realistic shadow on floor.
- Direction: SAME as shadows on person's body
- Softness: SAME as lighting hardness on person
- Length: Appropriate to light angle

## FAIL EXAMPLES (AVOID THESE)

BAD: Person has warm sunset glow, background is neutral gray
BAD: Person lit strongly from left, background looks evenly lit
BAD: Person has harsh shadows, floor shadow is soft/diffused
BAD: Person's body shadow falls right, ground shadow falls left

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

Background and person look like ONE unified photograph.
A viewer should NOT be able to tell this is a composite.
